For both the JAVA and PYTHON file, it has the same approach:

- Basically, you check the values of BOTH "p" and "q"
- THEN you compare it with the root's value

- If they're BOTH less than the root's value...
  - You would ONLY need to search through the LEFT subtree
    - (because the thing we need to return is in the LEFT subtree ONLY,
       so there's no need to search anywhere else)
  - So recurse through the LEFT subtree

- If they're BOTH greater than the root's value...
  - You would ONLY need to search through the RIGHT subtree
    - (Because the thing we need to return is in the RIGHT subtree ONLY,
       so there's no need to search anywhere else)
  - So recurse through the RIGHT subtree

- If they're anything ELSE...
  (i.e. one of them is equal to the root)
  (OR one is less than and the other is greater than)
    - Just return the root
